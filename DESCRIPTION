Description: Estimation,  by inverting a renewal equation,  
  of time-varying reproduction numbers, 7-day seasonality, and restored incidence 
  curves with festive days bias corrected as described in 
  Alvarez et al. (2021) <doi:10.1073/pnas.2105112118> and 
  Alvarez et al. (2022) <doi:10.3390/biology11040540>. 'EpiInvert' can manage 
  daily incidence data and weekly aggregated incidence data. This version of the
  package also includes 'EpiInvertForecast', a learning method for the short time 
  forecast of the restored incidence curve.
