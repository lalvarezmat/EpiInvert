Description: using variational techniques we address some epidemiological
    problems as the incidence curve decomposition by inverting the renewal 
    equation or the estimation of the functional relationship between 
    epidemiological indicators. We also propose a learning method for the 
    short time forecast of the trend incidence curve.
