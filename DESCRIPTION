Description: Using variational techniques we address some epidemiological
  problems as the incidence curve decomposition by inverting the renewal 
  equation as described in Alvarez et al. (2021) <doi:10.1073/pnas.2105112118> 
  and Alvarez et al. (2022) <doi:10.3390/biology11040540> or the estimation of 
  the functional relationship between epidemiological indicators. We also 
  propose a learning method for the short time forecast of the trend 
  incidence curve  as described in 
  Morel et al. (2022) <doi:10.1101/2022.11.05.22281904>.
