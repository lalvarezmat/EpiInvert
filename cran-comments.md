## Resubmission 3

This is the third resubmission of the first version of the package. In this 
version I have, following the suggestions of Uwe Ligges  (CRAN Teams):

* Changed the URL address http://www.ctim.es/covid19/EpiInvertVignette.html by
  https://ctim.ulpgc.es/covid19/EpiInvertVignette.html

* Changed the URL address http://www.ctim.es/covid19/RtComparison.html by
  https://ctim.ulpgc.es/covid19/RtComparison.html

I checked that the proposed URL address work properly.  
  
Now, when executing devtools::check_win_devel() this issue does not appear in 
the 00check.log file (I'm sorry I didn't notice this issue in the previous post) 

Thank you for your help.
